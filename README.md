# ICG_Project
Repository for practical project for ICG course (2024/2025)

## Concept
This project will be a skiing game where you control a skier and you must slalom between the gates in order to earn more time for yourself. There will be obstacles such as rocks and poles which you must avoid. You can control your character horizontally, as well as accelerate and slow him down.

There will be 3 cameras:
  - Topdown camera (possible Orthographic Camera), with the character on top of the camera and the obstacles coming from below
  - 3rd person camera from behind the character
  - 1st person camera, in which you can control the direction you are looking at with the mouse

There will be a day / night cycle, with its speed being configurable by the player

There will be many fonts of illumination:
  - The sun (Directional Light)
  - The character's headlight (Spot Light)
  - The gates small lights (Point Light)
  - Spotlight machines (Spot Light)

The character's headlight will also be able to be moved with the mouse in the 1st person view.

## Project Iterations - Currently on Step 1
**Step 1 - Model Creation**

During this time I will create the models for:
  - Character (skier)
  - Floor (snow mountain)
  - Trees (on the side of the mountain, prevent player from moving too much horizontally)
  - Gates (player needs to go past them)
  - Rock (obstacle)
  - Pole (obstacle)
  - Spotlight (illumination)

**Step 2 - Model combination into scene**

During this time I will combine the models into a scene. In here, I will also implement the horizontal movement for the character, since it is more visible here.
I will also create the cameras in this step (needing some modification of the Character which will include one of the cameras)

**Step 3 - Gamification**

During this time I will figure out how to get the score to show on the screen, make the Floor move and generate more Trees, Gates, Rocks and Poles as it moves along. 
I will figure out how to get the different objects to interact with the character
I will figure out how to create a main screen

**Step 4 - Intermediate Presentation**

It should be during this time that I deliver my intermediate presentation. It's possible that I have not done everything from Step 3 by this time, but by that time I should at least already be halfway through

**Step 5 - Advanced Lighting**

During this time I will work mostly on the night vision - at Step 2 I will forecefully need to implement some sort of light already, but at this time is when I create the headlight (again will need to change the character's code), the lights from the gates and the light coming from the spotlights. 

**Step 6 - ???**

I haven't planned this far ahead yet but will update this README.md when I have an idea of what I need to do.
