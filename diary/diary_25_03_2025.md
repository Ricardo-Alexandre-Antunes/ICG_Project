Tasks:
- Continue working on the skier's score

Thoughts:

This is proving to be a really difficult task. For some reason, which I can't seem to comprehend, the position of the gates is all messed up. Because the gates are connected to the mountain, and not even to the plane, with all the rotations and such, their position relative to the plane make it so that their absolute position is not the same as their relative position. Therefore, comparing the gates's position with the skier's position is a challenge.

Hence why I've been trying to do this for 3 days now!

The AxesHelper helped me visualize the planes. What I am looking for is the NEGATIVE y-axis value. Even then, weirdly enough the z-distance is still not quite right.
