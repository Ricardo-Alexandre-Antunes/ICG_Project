Tasks:
- Continue working on the skier's score

Thoughts:

I began implementing a function in the mountain object that tracks every skier's position / score, but there's a bug in there that gives the skier a ton of negative points right at the start. My task for today is to try and erradicate this bug, and make the score work.

This is proving to be a difficult task, as I just can't seem to properly locate the relative distance between the skier and the gates. It will continue to be investigated tomorrow...
