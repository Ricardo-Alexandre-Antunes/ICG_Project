Tasks:
- Improve quality of skier's turning

Thoughts:

I managed to figure out that the rotation axis was wrong and the skier can now turn but it turns way too quickly - i can just cap the maximum speed but it also rotates a bit weirdly so my attempts so far were not the greatest. I think for now I will just cap the speed and leave the details for later.

Not much else was done today due to other projects
