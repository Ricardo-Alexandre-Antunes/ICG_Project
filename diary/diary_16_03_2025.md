Tasks:
- Make the gate model
- Make the rock model
- Make the pole model
- Make the spotlight model (optional for today)

Thoughts:

Today I will make 3 simpler models than the character model. I bet there is a rock model available online that I can steal. If that is the case, I will use it and document here the source. 

For the gate model, in principle it's just 2 cylinders and a block connecting them, with alternating colors, as well as pointlights on top of the cylinders, the problem being that if I want to implement some sort of physics to the gates (like the block being more like a plastic thing that is affected by gravity, and the gate being hit by the skier) it will probably be much more difficult.

For the pole model it will be a cylinder with a sphere on top. I don't think it is worth overcomplicating things.

I will implement the spotlight machines as well if there is time today.

I could not find a three.js library or file that would create a rock, however I managed to get ChatGPT to help me create a rock. I purposefully place this rock in y = 0 so that only half of it can be seen (like a rock placed on the ground). Each time a rock is generated, it comes out in a different shape.

I can use the scaling to manipulate the shape of the rock, something I will do when I'm generating them on the track.

I was also able to create the gates.

I took the chance and added some point lights to the gates. They will be visible at night.

In doing this, I discovered an issue with the lighting - the lights only showed up for one of the cameras and not the other, particularly the 3rd person camera did not show most of the lights.
